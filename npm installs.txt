How to allow the cloud function to read the new file url:

1. go to the 'iam' api in the google developers console, for this specific project. A link will show in the cloud functions log after a failed attempt prior to enabling.
A sample link would look something like this:
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/iam.googleapis.com/overview?project=550178105554

2. Enable.

3. go to the IAM tab on the left, and look for "App Engine default service account". Click on the edit pencil on it's right.

4. Click add another role

5. Add Service managment -> Cloud functions service agent

6. Save
